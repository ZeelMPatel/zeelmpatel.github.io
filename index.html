            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <p>I live in New York City.</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Alberta, Canada is home (and where I grew up), but I was born in India</li>
                <li>I am interested in quantitative finance, deep learning, modelling biological systems, and supercomputers</li>
                <li>Philosophers I admire include: Francis Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant, and René Descartes</li>
                <li>In another life, I would have pursued a career in storytelling — and love literature that explores worldbuilding, games within games, and sci-fi (e.g. Tolkien, Cixin Liu, R.R. Martin, Herbert) </li>
                <li>I aspire to explore every country on Earth, and am grateful to be <a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/ZeelPatel">21% of the way there</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Background & Work</h2>
            <p>I am currently serving a 15 month non-compete with <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/">Citadel Securities</a>, the quantitative trading firm.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>During this time, I am a senior advisor on AI to <a href="https://alphasquaregroup.com/">a $1B+ AUM venture capital firm</a> based in NYC </li>
                <li>My priorities during this sabbatical are to catch up on readings at the deep learning frontier — in particular, the latest results in sequence modelling, multi-agent systems, and <a href="https://github.com/evo-design/evo">DNA foundation models</a></li>
                <li>Please do not reach out with employment opportunities — I will have to politely decline</li>
                <li>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/">Citadel Securities</a>, on the Special Projects team based out of NYC</li>
                <li>Before that, I worked at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a> in Seattle</li>
                <li>I studied Computer Science and Economics at Harvard University</li>
                <li>At Harvard, much of my time was spent working at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">Broad Institute of Harvard/MIT</a>, which culminated in a <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37371768">senior thesis supervised by <a href="https://dtak.github.io/">Professor Finale Doshi-Velez</a> on modelling healthcare information</a></li>
                <li>When I was younger, I was very involved in the national science fair, olympiad, and debate circuits across Canada</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Interests & Projects</h2>
            <p>On the highest level, I am interested in building <i><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1968.1972">prediction machines</a></i> — systems that learn the underlying distribution of information in a given setting through data, and correctly sample from this distribution at inference time.</p>
            <p><strong>Quantitative Biology:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A grand challenge I am personally interested in is <a href="https://docs.karrlab.org/intro_to_wc_modeling/master/0.0.1/">modelling a virtual cell</a></li>
                <li>I am inspired by the AlphaFold results, which uncovered the underlying <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/02/15/protein-linguistics/">manifold representing the distribution of proteins</a>, and believe similar manifolds exist throughout the cell (DNA, lipids, etc) due to evolutionary pressure from nature</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Finance & Capital Markets:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am highly interested in the quantitative trading industry, and how <a href="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SIFMA-Insights-Electronic-Trading-Market-Structure-Primer.pdf">markets have evolved concurrently with progress in computing</a>. I am interested in new frontiers for market structure, exchange matching algorithms for improved price discovery, and auction design</li>
                <li>I've enjoyed literature on <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/b4ff84b2d5dc4d0963a5074102460cc1-0350012022/related/Commodity-Markets-Chapter-1.pdf">the history of commodity markets</a> — starting with the <a href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/dojima/en/index.html">Dojima rice exchange in Japan</a> (the first modern futures market) to the development of <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/openmarkets/energy/2023/the-40-year-story-of-a-crude-oil-benchmark.html">lit oil markets</a> — and how centralizing trade among these markets has accelerated global development</li>
                <li>I believe prices — and improvements in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1910871">technology that lower the price or increasive the produtivity per unit of a good</a>— tell the story of economic growth (and often social/political stability of nations) better than any other variable in the long-run</li>
                <li>In finance outside of trading and markets, I also have an interest in the deal-making business — specifically private equity and venture investing</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Computer Science:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every few years, I try to re-read the classics of computer science, and have <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tlsKSeJrTP3r7ITQS3ql-Z4ZpR-K-zG67Q5htzrRbA/edit?usp=sharing">built a sheet of the key papers that defined the field</a></li>
                <li>Recently, my interests have been in deep learning, specifically in new architectures for data-efficient learning, long-context sequence modelling, and multi-agent systems</li>
                <li>The fact that computers can now build an increasingly accurate representation of information in the universe — through learning the underlying distribution of training data — is in and of itself remarkable</li> 
                <li>The fact that we can sample from this distribution — both to understand reality and potentially produce net-new knowledge — makes these systems highly desirable</li>
                <li>A promising research direction I am tracking is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/64b1bb33-095e-4cc5-a911-50df76fa3d1d">teaching models how to accurately action tools</a>: both in the digital world (software, operating systems, etc) and by extension the physical world (microscopes, vehicles, etc), with <a href=https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2406320121>applications in AI for automating scientific research</a></li>
                <li>I believe the demand for compute follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevon's paradox</a> — and that recent <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf">results with search and planning</a> of AI systems illustrates the demand for supercomputing will stand the test of time</li>
                <li>On a systems level, I am interested in new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07147">orchestration engines for managing compute containers at scale</a>, programming languages centered around tensor artifacts with the performance latency of C++, and the relationship between datacenters and power markets</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Business & Investing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a limited capacity, I will cut small checks into startups going after frontiers I am passionate about, especially when I have a pre-existing relationship with the founder</li>
                <li>A new venture I am interested in is the creation of a new market structure for global compute, especially GPU compute time, to treat it as a true commodity with price discovery. I believe this will help accelerate progress in AI significantly</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At Harvard, I served as the President of HPAIR, and organized a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/world-leaders-ceos-global-celebrities-gather-at-harvard-university-for-the-hpair-summit-1030828521">summit with Global CEOs, Heads of State, and World Leaders</a> that Business Insider called <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-davos-of-harvard-a-group-of-students-organizes-one-of-the-largest-virtual-conferences-with-world-leaders-1029938314">the "Davos of Harvard"</a></li>
                <li>I was once roped into a <a href="https://github.com/ZeelMPatel">side-project to detect exoplanets from astronomy data</a> using neural networks for a summer</li>
            </ul>
